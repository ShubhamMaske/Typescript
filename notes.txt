#What is Typescript
TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript developed and maintained by Microsoft. It adds static typing 
and other features to JavaScript, making it a powerful tool for developing large-scale applications. 
TypeScript code is transpiled into plain JavaScript, which can run in any environment that supports JavaScript.
